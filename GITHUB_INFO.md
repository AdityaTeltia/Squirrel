# Squirrel 🐿️

**Hoard knowledge like a squirrel hoards nuts**

An AI-powered Chrome extension that saves, organizes, and searches through web content with the enthusiasm of a squirrel preparing for winter.

## What is Squirrel?

We all hoard information - bookmarks we never revisit, tabs we promise to read "later", snippets of wisdom scattered across the web. Squirrel embraces this reality and makes it actually useful.

Select any text on the web, right-click to squirrel it away, then search or chat with your collection using AI. It's like having a personal librarian for your digital hoarding habit.

## Features

- 🐿️ **One-Click Save**: Right-click → "Save to Squirrel" (we're all hoarders, embrace it)
- 🏷️ **AI Auto-Tagging**: Automatically categorizes your nuts... er, notes
- 🔍 **Smart Search**: Find that one thing you saved 3 months ago
- 💬 **AI Chat**: "What did I save about X?" - finally, your hoard answers back
- 🔒 **Privacy-First**: Your stash stays local by default (or sync to cloud)
- 🎨 **Clean UI**: Because even digital hoarding should look good
